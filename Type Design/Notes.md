# Type Design Notes/Documentation

Here's the basic set up I use for maintaining notes while working on type. I primarily work in Glyphs App so I store these notes in the Font Info "Notes" section.

# Documentation

**Quick Reference**
- Anything that needs to be quickly referenced
- Or numbers that need to be preserved

## 0.002

**Reason for new file**
- It's easy to walk away from a file for months.
- Which means it's very easy to forget what you were doing last.
- So I make note of what major change constituted a new file.

**Notes**
- General notes & changes go here like:
- Switched the “normal” `/S` with `/S.ss01`
- Added an additional instance to up it to six weights.

**Glyphs to pay attention to**
- This is where I keep track of glyphs that can be difficult or that I need to be sure to keep an eye on.
- `$, ¢` (Bracket layers)
